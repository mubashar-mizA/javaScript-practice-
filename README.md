# My JavaScript Practice Repository
# Mubashar Siddique

This is my **JavaScript practice repo**, where I explore and reinforce various JavaScript concepts. It's my go-to space for hands-on coding practice, trying out new ideas, and my understanding of different topics.

## Purpose

-- **Focus on improving** my JavaScript skills through consistent practice.
- **Dive into areas** I need to strengthen, from basic syntax to advanced topics.
- **Work on small projects** and challenges to apply what I've learned.
- **Track My Progress**Use this repo to document my journey and see how far I've come over time.

## How I Use It

1. **Review and Reflect**: Periodically review my code to identify areas of improvement.
2. **Document Learnings**: Keep notes and comments within the repo to track what I've learned and areas to revisit.
